#The data is now in a 'tibble' (like a spreadsheet for R). Let's use the head function to look at the first few rows:

#Now we use loops to complete our task. We begin by creating a new variable in our dataset, gini, which we initially set to 0 for all country-year combinations.
decile_data$gini <- 0

noc <- nrow(decile_data)

}
#With this code, we calculated 4,799 Gini coefficients without having to manually run the same command 4,799 times. We now look at some summary measures for the gini variable.
#First we use the subset function to select Nordic countries and save their data as temp_data. As an example, we have chosen four anglophone countries: the UK, the US, Ireland, and Australia.

  decile_data, Country %in% c("United States","Sweden","Finland","Norway",

#Now we plot the data using ggplot.
